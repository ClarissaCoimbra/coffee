HELLO THERE!

THIS IS A SIMPLE PROJECT BASED ON LESSONS FROM : https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript

I LOVE TO DRINK COFFEE AND I LOST TRACK OF MANY COFFEES I DRINK DURING THE DAY. SO I THOUGHT, WHY NOT KEEP A REGISTER FOR IT?

it's a silly tiny small thing, just to dip my toes into the programming pool and learning how to make some functions, don't take it as a mockery, it's just for fun!üôÇÔ∏è
